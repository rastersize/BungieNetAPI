 This is a flags enumeration/bitmask field, as you may have to look in multiple sources across multiple components for valid plugs.
 For instance, a socket could have plugs that are sourced from its own definition, as well as plugs that are sourced from Character-scoped AND profile-scoped Plug Sets. Only by combining plug data for every indicated source will you be able to know all of the plugs available for a socket. */
